I teach children how to make an origami.
Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami (“paper”).
 Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.
